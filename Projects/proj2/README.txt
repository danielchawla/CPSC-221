Acknowledgments: code for max_heap functions adapted directly from Unit 2 slides

To the best of my knowledge, code compiles and is working as expected. Fully implemented all functionality Part 1 to Part 3 as described in instructions.

Comments:
1. Code best viewed when Tab Width is 2.
2. All testing output is sent to output.txt file as requested in instructions. 
No testing output is sent to command line. To see test results, open output.txt
3. Also, output.txt file is removed and recreated each time main is run.
